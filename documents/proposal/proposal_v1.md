# Taking Two Steps Back (With Publication Data): The Epistemological Presupposition of Scholarly Communication

## Introduction

Social media have become an integral part of society, including the scientific community. Not only are popular services, such as Facebook and Twitter, used and embraced by academics (van Noorden, 2014), but platforms tailored towards the needs of researchers, like ResearchGate and Academia.edu, are highly successful (Ponte & Simon, 2011; Moran, Seaman, & Tinti-Kane, 2011). In the wake of the recent publication crisis (Panitch and Michalak, 2005) and the rise of social media, scholarly communication and especially non-traditional metrics for science impact (altmetrics) are gaining traction. In his current project on *Understanding the Societal Impact of Research through Social Media*, Dr. Alperin et al. (n.d) points out that it is time for the scholarly communication community to take a step back and examine the theoretical frameworks that underpin how we construct research metrics, as well as how we evaluate and interpret researcher's activities and outputs. Despite the explosion of new 'alternative' metrics (beyond citations), there has been little work to develop a theory of scholarly metrics, beyond the literature that exists on citations. One of the few examples that they point out is Haustein et al. (2015), who build on the existing theories of citations and propose a compound of research programs from various academic disciplines to investigate the motivations of social media behavior in scholarship (e.g., social constructivism, normative theory, and other social theories).

Despite the promising nature of this work, I propose to take a second step back, to further examine the very epistemological presuppositions of a research program in the field of scholarly communication, and its implications for empirical research in scholarly communication. Haustein et al.'s (2015) suggestion of a polytheoretic framework for social media behaviour exemplifies the demand for scrutiny, as the overarching term of constructivism (i.e., social, radical, and cognitive constructivism) often represents a diverging variety of assumptions about central ideas such as the nature of personhood, the existence of objective knowledge or intersubjectivity. I propose to study the conceptual scaffolding of research and practices in scholarly communication, especially in regard to epistemological assumptions, from two disjoint perspectives: the human agent (authors, readers, "sharers", etc.) and the underlying technology used to distribute, read and share (with a special focus on social media). While the former is motivated by my experience in cognitive science and will draw inspirations from the philosophy of mind, the latter part will be chiefly guided by Dr. Feenberg's application of critical theory to a philosophy of technology.

Coming from an engineering background and engaging in a data-driven field such as scholarly communication, I want to avoid a complete "armchair philosopher" method. As a proponent of empirically-informed philosophy (Prinz, 2008) (e.g., experimental moral philosophy, experimental epistemology), empirical data-driven research will play a vital role. Inspired by methods from phenomenological research in the brain sciences (e.g., Neurophenomenology (Varela, 1996), First-Person Neuroscience (Northoff & Heinzel, 2006)) that tries to combine first and third person data as well as traditional social sciences, I hope to bridge the gap between epistemology and methodology in scholarly communication research.

The present research proposal comprises both theoretical and practical work; the former drawing inspirations from the critical theory and philosophy of technology, and philosophy of mind; while the latter builds on the work of Dr. Alperin and his research group on scholarly communication and social media. I hope that these contributions will lead to the development of a holistic framework of scholarly communication research; holistic in a twofold way: (1) a theory that considers the individual participant in scholarly communication as an experiencing subject and the involved technology in a non-instrumentalist and critical manner and (2) avoids the "armchair philosopher" approach by embracing empirical research.

## Objectives

Scholarly communication has been changing rapidly over the last two decades. While some scholars might disagree on the specific name and details, many authors seem to agree that a revolution is currently underway in science communication---be it Harnad's (1991) *cognitive revolution*, Cronin's (2012) *velvet revolution*, or Nielsen's (2016) *open science revolution*. As Sugimoto et al. (2016) observe, the common theme across all these "revolutions" is an increased visibility and heterogeneity of science itself, driven especially by the Web 2.0 and, more specifically, the recent of rise of social media in scholarship. Simultaneously the emergence of new vehicles of disseminating science caused an increased demand for alternative indicators and metrics of science impact---the aforementioned *altmetrics*.

Despite an abundance of collectable data (scientometrics, bibliometrics, altmetrics), scholarly communication remains a profoundly human and social activity, which brings forth the question of the subjective experience of producing, disseminating, and consuming knowledge. While from a positivist or instrumental rationalist standpoint it might be desirable to reduce scholarly activity to "objective" measures, I believe that an approach that acknowledges the irreducibility of the individual and "lived experience", might be a better fit to understand the dynamics of scholarly communication. In the fashion of empirically-informed philosophy, I am planning to explore the *interplay of individuals as experiencing subjects* *and the community/public* from the perspective of modern scholarly communication, especially in the digital domain.

While I want to emphasize the importance of the individual researcher\'s experience, participation, and contribution in scholarly communication, I believe that another essential aspect is the structure of the underlying technology. Recent changes in the way scholarly communication is practiced, as well as studied, have been strongly driven by technological advances (i.e., the use of social media to disseminate research, and the emergence of altmetrics as a form of measurement and assessment were largely enabled by technological progress, namely the advance of the social web) (Sugimoto et al., 2016). At the same time, social media and altmetrics are changing the very nature of scholarship by influencing the academic incentive system. Altmetrics just being one example, I want to engage in a critical analysis of technology in scholarly communication. I will use Dr. Feenberg's work in the critical theory of technology, especially the instrumentalization theory, which combines approaches from the philosophy of technology as well as empirical and constructivist methods. This framework, a "synthesis of theoretical and empirical approaches" (Feenberg, 2009, p.62), will serve as a scaffolding for a critical and empirical account of technology in scholarly communication.

Guided by two perspectives, one focussing on the individual actor and the other on the underlying technology, I want to evaluate current practices in scholarly communication, as well as epistemological and methodological assumptions of research in scholarly communication, social media, and altmetrics.

## Summary

I propose to establish a basis for one or more unified frameworks for research in scholarly communication from two disjoint perspectives: (1) an individual-centric point of view---in contrast to traditional and modern metrics of science that reduce scholarly communication to quantified research outputs, ignoring the researcher (and the audience) as experiencing individual; (2) focusing on technology in scholarly communication guided by Dr. Feenberg's work in the critical theory of technology---modern scholarly communication is driven by technology, which in turn also adapts to the needs of scholarship.

To escape the limits of pure "armchair philosophy" a close collaboration with Dr. Alperin and his lab will be essential throughout all stages of this work. "Only through an approach that is both critical and empirically oriented is it possible to make sense of what is going on around us now" (Feenberg, 2009, p.62)

I am aware that the scope of the proposed work is ample, nevertheless I hope, that a few, albeit tentative steps towards a unified framework will contribute to the establishment of a critical scholarly communication---one that addresses researchers and their outputs, the audience, and the means of communication on equal grounds, while considering social, historical and political structures in the world surrounding us.

## Proposed Project Outline

As laid out in the previous section, the proposed theoretical framework attempts to unite two different strands of approaches into a coherent line of research. While both the phenomenology of participating in scholarly communication, as well as, the structure of underlying technology is considered, this project aims to consolidate theoretical and empirical methods in a constructive and feasible manner. To further explore and elaborate this approach, I want to outline my research idea and briefly discuss three research questions. The proposed outline already takes the proposed program timeline into account. After the completion of the course work and comprehensive examinations, I suggest to split the project in three stages, each to be completed within 8 months, resulting in a total of two years to complete the project.

### Has the academic identity and worth been reduced to quantitative metrics?

What does it mean to be an academic? Researchers provided a plethora of answers, but usually agreed on the fact that the issue of academic identity is very complex (Quigley, 2011; Archer, 2008), and that the dynamics underlying the formation of 'academic identity' are changing (Clegg, 2008; Henkel, 2005). Clegg (2008) emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the way these changes in academia are experienced. Archer (2008, p.401) points out that the "'new times' of contemporary academia, with \[the\] increased pressures for performance and production" might have led to unstable academic identities. Finally, Davies and Petersen (2005, p.33) bring in the notion of a 'corporate' university in:

"The 'Enterprise University' and the signifying practices that come with it are, it seems, everywhere apparent -- although its inevitable affects (sic) on academic work and day-to-day practices, and on academic identities, has yet to be adequately researched."

In accordance with these appeals, I propose to investigate, whether the 'academic identity' has been reduced to alternative metrics, driven by the emergence and spread of social networks and digital identities. Following the previously outlined framework, I am intending to answer this question by answering the following three questions through theoretical and empirical work.

1. What are the epistemological implications of reductionist altmetrics? (8 months)

2. How does the understanding of the relationship between academic offline/online identity differ across academics in different career stages? (8 months)

3. Do scientist's online profiles on social networks and corresponding altmetrics correlate with self-reported offline profiles? (8 months)

While the first sub-question situates the phenomenon under investigation in a philosophical framework, the two empirical sub-questions aim to explore and study the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of it. Each individual question will address an aspect of the overarching research question, but the questions will also potentially critique and guide each other\'s findings. E.g., the identified qualitative core concepts in the focus group could serve as apriori knowledge for any quantitative analysis of gathered offline/online data, while the theoretical work on the nature of the reduction of the academic identity might point towards a structure for a qualitative inquiry. Further detail on the three questions follows.

**RQ1 What are the epistemological implications of reductionist altmetrics?**

Reductionists believe that one theory or phenomenon can be reduced to another theory or phenomenon (Ney, n.d.). Reductionist theories can be observed across the whole of science, mostly dominated by variations of physicalism, which claims that all theories (including theories of the mind) can be reduced to physical explanations. While reductionism has proven its usefulness in many fields of modern science (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, ...), some researchers also pointed out the dangers (i.e., epistemological and methodological flaws, overlooked societal and political impact) of overt commitment to reductionism (Choudhury & Slaby, 2011). This exposition will investigate a reductionist theory of academic identity and outline the epistemological and metaphysical implications for scholarly communication.

**RQ2 How does the understanding of the relationship between academic offline/online identity differ across academics in different career stages?**

By conducting focus group I want to tap into the qualitative aspects of maintaining an academic online profile. Furthermore, the question of how a potential reduction of academic identity might express itself in researchers will be investigated. The different groups will consist of researchers in the same career stage (undergraduate and graduate students, researchers in postdoc and tenure positions). This question will identify core concepts around the use/maintenance of academic profiles, the experience of a potential reduction to numbers and metrics and also the motivation for engaging in an online community.

**RQ3 Do scientist's online profiles on social networks and corresponding altmetrics correlate with self-reported offline profiles?**

This question will quantify and explore possible connections between the online and offline profiles of academics. The measurement of online profiles comprises basic profile information from ResearchGate and available altmetric information. The offline profile (a self-reported measurement of academic identity) is measured by an online questionnaire sent to all academics within the targeted community. The questionnaire will be developed based on existing research (Nasir et al., 2009; Hyland, 2011).
