# Feenberg Readings

## Critical Theory of Technology:

### Technology and Finitude

### Instrumentalization Theory

### Culture

### Operational Autonomy

### Resistance

## Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power, and Democracy

The democratization of work is required in addition to the political but has not been achieved in any example throughout history.

Two different camps reasoning for that:

- Modern technology is incompatible with workforce democratization
- technology is not responsible for the concentration of industrial power

Andrew argues in this paper for the second point but elaborates:

> the role of technology, which I see as _neither_ determining nor neutral.

### Dystopian Modernity

Technological determinism, rationality, and efficiency as the criterion of technological development.

Weber's theory of rationalization is the original argument against industrial democracy.

rationalization
: the increasing role of calculation and control in social life, a trend leading to what he called the 'iron cage' of bureaucracy

Investigating the role of rationalization in scholarly communication might be important.

> objects of technique, incorporated into the mechanisms we have created (p.303)

### Technological Determinism

Technologicl determinism describes the relation between the social and technology. Determinists argue that technology has its own logic and rationale and is only connected to the social realm in as far as it serves humans and its purposes.

> Technology would thus resemble science and mathematics by its intrinsic independence of the social world. (p.304)

Dystopian visions of modernity usually rely on a deterministic idea of technology. Technological determinism has two premises:

1. The thesis of unilinear progress
2. The thesis of determination by the base

### Constructivism

Constructivism argues for the underdetermination of technology by scientific and technical criteria.

1. There are always multiple, workable solutions and the choice is, in the end, up to the social actor
2. Problem-definitions are moving targets and often change during the solution

interpretative flexibility
: the ambiguity in the meaning of technology in development

### Indeterminism

Sociology of technology shows how throughout history technology has been progressing on parallel tracks and adopting to changing social frameworks. Thus:

1. Technological development is not unilinear, but branches in different directions
2. Technology is overdetermined by technical and social factors

If technology is indetermined and contains all these hidden, unexplored potentialities, the social struggle between all these options becomes a deeply political one.Technology does not determine society.

### Interpreting society

An indeterministic (and intrinsically political) technology becomes a social object as any other part of our social lives.

> It can no longer be considered as a collection of devices, nor, more generally, as the sum of trational means. (p.307)

As a social object, technology ought to be subject to hermeneutic methods.

Two hermeneutic dimensions are suggested:

1. Social Meaning
2. Cultural Horizon

> The full picture is conveyed by studying the social role of the technical object and the lifestyles it makes possible.

**The Social Meaning of Technology**: Understanding technological development requires the study of the sociopolitical embedding of the groups involved in it.

### Technological Hegemony

_Cultural horizon_ as the second hermeneutic dimension becomes relevant once we look at the broader social implications. It is the basis for modern social hegemony.

hegemony
: the form of domination deeply rooted in society that it almost feels natural. distribution of power that comes with the force of culture.


horizon
: culturally general assumptions underlying every aspect of life

> Technological development is constrained by cultural norms originating in economics, ideolog, religion, and tradition. (p.309)

The design of machines (and algorithms!) reflects the social factors in the prevailing rationality. Example: Assembly line as an increase in productivitiy because labor-discipline is imposed from above.

This critique goes beyond the distinction of capitalism and socialism. This dichotomy becomes the difference between resting power on the technical mediation of social activities" and the democratization of technical control and technological design.

### Double-Aspect Theory

Social meaning and functional rationality are two sides of the same coin. There is no ontological distinction.

### The Social Relativity of Efficiency

### The Technical Code

### The Consequences of Technology

### The 'Essence' of Technology

### Conclusion: Subversive Rationalization
