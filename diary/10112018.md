# Notes after conversation with John Willinsky

Write drafts for the essay with Andrew about the topic scholarly communication and critical technology.

Current idea:

- Citations & Wittgenstein
- Citations & Marcuse
- Citations & Feenberg

John suggested to try to simply work through versions of the text with each framework and simply test various applications.

## About Citation Theory

Citations theories: most of them very static

## Citations and Wittgenstein

I've already presented on Wittgenstein and Scholarly Communication at FORCE11.

## Citations and Marcuse

## Citations and Feenberg
