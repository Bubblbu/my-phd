# Notes after conversation with John Willinsky

Write drafts for the essay with Andrew about the topic scholarly communication and critical technology.

Current idea:

- Citations & Wittgenstein
- Citations & Marcuse
- Citations & Feenberg

John suggested to try to simply work through versions of the text with each framework and simply test various applications.

## About Citation Theory

Cronin suggests that citations are to be understood as a cluster-concept. Various meanings, usages, and
Metaphors for citations:

- as scholarly bricks (Price, 1963)
- as signposts left behind (Smith, 1981)
- as applause (Nelson, 1997),
- as gifts (Hagstrom, 1982),
- as forms of reward or income (Ravetz, 1971),
- as tools of persuasion (Gilbert, 1977),
- as pellets of peer recognition (Merton, 2000),
- as paratextual baubles (Cronin, 2014),
- as frozen footprints on the landscape of scholarly achievement (Cronin, 1981)

"None of the metaphors I just mentioned quite does justice to the complexity of a practice, ...."

Cronin's favourite metaphor: **citations as conversation between texts** by Barbara Czarniawska-Joerges with the qualifier of a "particularly slow, asynchronous conversation".
