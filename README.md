I am planning to turn this repository into a place where I can document the status-quo of my PhD, collect any kind of information that helps, organise thoughts regarding the big picture, and most importantly track the changes over time.

## Research Statement

What is the role and impact of open infrastructure in scholarly communication? How do research metrics, citation indices, or open access initiatives influence the way scholars access, publish, and disseminate research? Can we shape and change the practices and culture of scholarly communication by creating more equitable and inclusive technical infrastructures? In this doctoral research project, Asura Enkhbayar is critically exploring the infrastructure of scholarly communication in the 21st century at the intersection of philosophy and technology. Building on a background in electronics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind, he is tackling this mediatized and data-intense domain both qualitatively and quantitatively.
